## Introduction

The objective of this report is to describe the development of a software that explores a particular topic on this subject.

The selected topic was to re-implement the Diffraction shader from the first volume of GPU Gems (@Fernando2004). The original implementation uses the Cg shading language and deprecated OpenGL functions, so the reimplementation uses OpenGL ES 2.0 and GLSL shading language.

This topic delves into vector operations for simulating light behaviour.

## Review of Diffraction Simulation

### What is Diffraction?

This describes what diffraction is, with figures. 

### Original Implementation

The original implementation is contained in the [nVIDIA Developers site](http://www.nvidia.com/object/gpu_gems_cd.html), being implemented with OpenGL 1.x functions, and treating Cube map textures as extensions.

## Reimplementation of the Shader
